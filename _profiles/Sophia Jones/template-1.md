Reinforcement learning researcher at the University of Bath, in the CDT for accountable, responsible and transparent AI. 

I am interest in the complex graphical structure generated by interactions between a reinforcement learning agent and its environment, and how this structure can be exploited for more efficient learning. My current projects use these graph networks for value function approximation, and for interpreting the policy an agent is pursuing.

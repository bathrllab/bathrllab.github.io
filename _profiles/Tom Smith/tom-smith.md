<!-- fill in description of your research or who you are - Dont need this if you want to link to personal website -->

I am interested in how agents can learn to represent the world around them as predictive knowledge, and how they can use this knowledge to better complete tasks. In particularly my research addresses methods for agents to learn which behaviours can be completed successfully in their surroundings, and to predict the consequences of these behaviours. 

Currently I am considering methods for learning and applying affordances. Affordance is best captured by the question "what can I do here?". It describes the behaviours that a particular agent is able to complete given some environment features. For example, a button affords being pressed, or a door affords being opened. These affordances can speed up learning and planning for an agent.

I am a PhD student at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Accountable, Responsible and Transparent AI (ART-AI), University of Bath. My research interests lie in artificial intelligence, with a focus on reinforcement learning.

**Research Summary**: I am interested in the capacity of AI systems with limited resources to acquire generalisable behaviours that facilitate continual learning. Specifically, I focus on two main areas: discovering broad and generalised skills that allow for continual adaption to change and explaining the behaviour of these agents by revealing how they are influenced by their observations. For further details and my publications, please refer to my personal website.

# Research

My research focuses on the problem of skill discovery: how should autonomous agents develop increasingly complex behaviours on their own, without human intervention, as they interact with the world? This is a central unanswered question in artificial intelligence.

# Teaching

I am also employed as a lecturer at the university. I currently teach our on-campus reinforcement learning units (CM50270 and CM30359), and have previously authored an online version for our remote MSc AI programme (CM500336). I am open to supervising third and fourth-year students who wish to complete dissertation projects related to reinforcement learning.
